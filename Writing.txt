Last weekend, my father wanted to take us out somewhere. So we decided to go to the zoo. My mother made some sandwiches and packed some fruits. Father took his camera along, and we all left for the zoo.
Outside, it was warm and sunny. After an hour’s drive, we reached the zoo. The place was crowded. There were vendors selling balloons, caps, eatables and lot of other things.
My father bought three tickets and we all walked into the zoo. Inside we boarded a small train which took us around the park. I was so excited that I kept jumping on my seat.
As the train moved slowly around the park, we saw a lion, a white tiger, hippopotamus, deer, giraffes and hyenas.
After the train ride, we saw my favourite thing, panda. The panda is eating a bamboo in a grassland. Suddently, a naughty boy throw a apple in the grassland. The panda was shocked. It don’t know what is that red weird thing. The secuarty came in and took the boy out. 
After that we sat in a restaurant and had our lunch. While walking around the zoo, I saw boards which warned us not to feed the animals. I could not understand the reason behind it. When I asked my father about it, he explained that our food might harm the animals. He also told me that the zoo authorities take care of the animals in best possible manner.
After lunch, we left for our home though I wanted to stay back and go for the train ride again.
